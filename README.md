A student grading system is a software application or platform used by educational institutions to manage and record student assessment data. It allows teachers to input and calculate grades for assignments, exams, and other assessments, providing a comprehensive overview of each student's academic performance. The system often includes features for generating reports, calculating GPAs, and facilitating communication between teachers, students, and parents regarding progress and performance. It streamlines the grading process, enhances transparency, and helps in making informed educational decisions.
